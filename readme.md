# Welcome. 

This is a project ive been working on for my leadership class.

## How does it work? 

The basic premis goes as followed: Classmates will go to the website and naviagte to the "game" page. From here a instruction video will be played. This instruction video will display the question that is asked. Classmates will then answer the icebreaker and add their first name into the "Name" box and a clue to who they are. 

These answers will then be displayed along with the clue (The name will not be public) and classmates will have to guess who said what based of the clue.
